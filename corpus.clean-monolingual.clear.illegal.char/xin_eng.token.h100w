new york crime falls , but people don 't feel safer 
crime in new york city is dropping fast , the latest police statistics show , but criminologists cannot give a single explanation . 
murders , which had been falling gradually over the previous three years , dropped sharply , by nearly a $number , in $number 
over all , $number fewer people were slain in $date than in the year before , and $number fewer than in $date , when murders , many of them fueled by the crack epidemic , reached a peak . 
according to the police statistics , shooting dropped by $number percent , and virtually every type of reported felony declined in frequency last year , with auto theft , grand larceny , burglary and robbery all dropping by better than $number percent .

they offer a number of theories , from intensified police efforts to demographic shifts to a growing number of criminals behind bars , but no single explanation for the phenomenon . 
the new york times $time quoted joan mccord , a criminology professor , as saying , " it 's possible it is due to a fluctuation in the age of the population , with fewer people in the crime-committing ages of $number to $number " 
" it 's possible that the increasing concern people are showing about crime is helping to define better values as people speak more loudly on the issue , " mccord added . 
" as far as advances in policing go , there are so many experiments around the country that it 's hard to tell which ones are effective . " 
although the crime statistics are dropping , new yorkers are not feeling really safer . 
a new york times and cbs news poll found that about two- $number s of new york city residents thought crime was as bad as ever or growing worse . 
some sociologists and criminologists say many people 's fears stem less from the numbers of crimes committed than from the types of crimes and their viciousness - - especially those committed by teen-agers . 
in fact , experts note that while crimes committed by people over the age of $number are plunging , teen-age crime remains high . and those crimes are typically more unpredictable and spontaneous than those committed by older criminals .

the officials added that they would work harder to cover all urban areas and more rural areas of the province with the new pension insurance system in the near future .

roundup : hong kong bourse bearish in $date ( by yang guoqiang ) 
hong kong stock market suffered a crash in $date when it slid $number points or $number percent to close at $number on the year 's last trading day , registering the sharpest slump among major bourses worldwide following the previous year 's overheated market . 
the hang seng index , key indictor of local blue chips , shed $number percent of its value on $date after its record high $number points on $date , $number trading day of the year . 
last $date 's turnover was $number hk dollars ( $number u.s. dollars ) , the year 's low compared with the $number ( $number u.s. dollars ) recorded on $date . 
local brokers say the surge at the beginning and the plunge at the end of $date painted an overall bearish picture for the whole year , making the market drop from the world 's $number biggest in $date to $number a year later . 
the stocks ' freefall would cast negative effect on the market outlook until $number 
analysts mainly blame the year 's bear runs , starting in early $date , on the six-time interest rate hike by the us federal reserve , fears of continued falling property prices in hong kong and lack of liquidity of overseas investors . 
the most recent us interest rate rise in mid- $date triggered off a consistent yet adverse effect on the local market as the hk dollar is pegged to the us dollar at a fixed exchange rate . 
local media warn that the negative sentiment from the us was undermining investors ' confidence in fund managers and forcing massive redemption from the unit trust industry . 
" the effect is snowballing . 
as investors redeem their money , fund managers have to liquidate their position in the equity market to free cash for redemption , " said priscilla ng , senior manager for institutional sales at ocbc securities . 
tumbling property asset values have a large impact on the earnings of large banks and property companies whereas $number percent of the local bourse 's earnings come from banking and property sectors . 
the local property stocks , which are the largest constituents in the hang seng , were reported to be hard-hit in $date following their best earnings at the end of $date and in early $date when the market was bullish and overheated in the morgan stanley shock . 
the property market started to slow down in $number quarter of $date in the wake of the local government 's implementation of new anti-speculation measures and banks ' tighter lending policies towards property investment . 
the interest rate hike in the last quarter put a further damper on the already sluggish property sector . 
observers estimate that the weak sentiment will continue in $number quarter of $date , when prices are expected to fall by $number percent . 
also in $date , h shares with chinese background suffered heavy losses , though nine new chinese enterprises were listed on the hong kong stock exchange . 
they failed to gain as much as their six counterparts which came to the local market a year earlier . 
however , the china factor would increase their portfolio weightings on the local bourse , as $number china-owned enterprises were reported to have registered in hong kong with a total investment of $number hk dollars ( $number us dollars ) , making china $number largest investor in hong kong after britain . 
according to sg warbury , the britain-based investment bank , despite the bearish forecast , an imminent injection of cash into the market would help in the short-term period and hong kong has benefited from what it calls the global " $date effect " in which a positive outlook on the new year spills over to the stock market . 
the success of $date is partially accounted for by the powerful force of hong kong 's retail investors , who contribute $number percent of the market 's turnover . 
and punters have traditionally invested their year-end bonuses and $number - month salary checks in shares . 
nevertheless , salomon brothers ' economists and researchers predict little hope for a recovery before $number half of $date for the world equity markets . 
it is the same with the hong kong market . 
timothy moe , head of equity research for asia pacific region , expects the hong kong and the chinese mainland economies to experience a cyclical upturn in $number half of $date which would provide grounds for " a good rebound " that could see the index climb as high as $number by the end of the year . 
some investment houses still classify hong kong as an emerging market in which the principle of high risk for high returns remains true . 
but they are less willing to accept losses from slumps in emerging markets . 
although a generally pessimistic sentiment looms over the coming months , brokers believe the local stock market in $date might cherish a slow recovery and rebound at $number - point level , better than most of asia 's bourses .

commentary : washington 's barbarous action against china ( by yin qian ) 
using as a pretext china 's so-called piracy of its intellectual property rights , the u.s. government threatened $time to impose trade sanctions against china , if its demands are not met by $date . 
u.s. trade representative mickey kantor $time presented a list of $number u.s. dollars worth of chinese imports- - including electronic products , shoes , toys , suitcases and other goods- - on which the u.s. would impose punitive tariffs of up to $number percent if the threatened trade sanctions are imposed . 
retaliation and trade sanctions are the old tricks often resorted to by washington in settling its trade disputes with other countries . 
the real motive behind this u.s. bluster is to exert pressure and force on the other side to make concessions conforming to its desires . 
with such an intention in mind , the united states is trying to negate the great efforts and marked progress made by china in protecting intellectual property rights . 
kantor is quoted as saying that " to date , china has been unwilling to take the necessary steps to protect american intellectual property rights . " 
he even said the degree of piracy in china " has gone from bad to worse " over the past year and a half . 
this accusation is totally groundless . 
in fact , china has completed its legislation on the protection of intellectual property rights within a dozen years , which had actually taken some developed countries several decades- - or even a century- - to do so . 
the chinese government , meanwhile , has been making efforts in enforcing its relevant laws and in cracking down on the piracy of intellectual property rights through both judicial and administrative means . 
however , the u.s. has turned a blind eye to the conspicuous and basic facts and has repeatedly raised unreasonable demands during the sino-u . s. talks on the issue . 
they have even interfered in china 's judicial and legislative process . 
during the talks in beijing in mid- $date , the u.s. delegation once again waved their wooden swords of retaliation and even threatened to block china 's re-entry to the general agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt). 
what 's more , the american delegates even walked out of the talks at crucial moment without informing the chinese side , thus breaking off the negotiations . 
but afterwards , the american side distorted the fact and put the blame on the chinese side . 
in international trade , it is quite normal for trading parties to have differences on specific issues . 
these differences should be settled step by step through consultation and negotiations on the basis of equality , which is also the basic norms in dealing with international affairs . 
it is , therefore , neither proper nor popular for one side to intimidate the other side with trade sanctions time and again while settling their trade disputes . 
and the chinese side would certainly not accept the unreasonable demands put forward by the americans concerning the protection of intellectual property rights . 
over the past few years , china and the u.s. have gained good momentum in economic and trade cooperation and exchange , which is beneficial to both sides . 
so , a full-fledged " trade war " will inevitably inflict losses not only on china but also on the u.s. . 
it may even harm the interests of other countries and regions which have direct or indirect involvement in trade with china or the united states . 
for this reason , the only way out for china and the united states is to take the whole situation into account and solve the sino-u . s. disputes through dialogue on the basis of mutual respect , equality and consultation .

roundup : shooting incident casts new shadow over israel-pna relations 
the shooting incident in the gaza strip $date night when three palestinian policemen were killed has cast new shadows over the already strained relations between israel and the palestinian national authority (pna). 
this was considered as the bloodiest clash between israeli forces and the palestinian police since gaza and jericho gained autonomy last $date 
it came on the same day when the israeli cabinet adopted a compromise resolution on the controversial issue of the efrat neighborhood near bethlehem . 
commanding officers from both sides met $time at the erez checkpoint to investigate the incident and discuss how to defuse the tense atmosphere over the incident . 
however , both sides are still blaming each other of starting the incident , 
palestinians said that the israeli attack was unprovoked and the three policemen were shot dead in their sleep . 
according to the israeli army , the incident started at $number local time ( $number gmt ) $date some $number meters south of the erez checkpoint when a routine army patrol was shot at as it passed a palestinian police position . 
the patrol fired back and called for reinforcement forces , which arrived at the scene within minutes . 
because there were no clear signs of surrender from the palestinians , the israeli troops assaulted the police building , resulting the deaths of three palestinian policemen but no israeli casualties , said the israeli army . 
at $time 's funeral in gaza of the three slain policemen , plo chairman yasser arafat praised them as martyrs who led palestinians on the road to jerusalem .

the incident has also affected the meeting of the israel-plo liaison committee $time in cairo .

on the efrat issue , though the israeli government has adopted a resolution , the row over the issue between israel and the palestinians is not over yet . 
under the resolution , the construction of a new neighborhood at disputed land of givat hatamar will be halted , but the construction plan will be shifted to nearby givat hazayit , also near efrat settlement . 
the ownership of givat hatamar , which was confiscated by israel in $date , was not touched upon in the resolution . 
the palestinians from el-khader villager claimed the land belongs to them . 
pna minister of municipal affairs saeb erakat $date criticized the resolution , saying that israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin " can not solve the problem by moving his bulldozers from one side of the mountain to the other . " 
" the issue we are talking about is the halting of all settlement activity , " he stressed , urging the israeli government to make a choice between settlements and peace , which in his words can not be put together . 
concerning palestinian activities in east jerusalem , the israeli police have stepped up security checks for palestinian-sponsored meetings and the knesset ( israel 's parliament ) last month passed a law restricting plo activities in the city . 
over the past few days , the israeli police have prevented at least two palestinian meetings in east jerusalem because of " security reasons . " 
with the negotiations on palestinian elections and israeli redeployment in the west bank still at stake , the recent events , especially $date night 's shooting incident , have undoubtedly cast new shadows over the israel-pna relations .

roundup : government draws criticism for decision on efrat issue ( by xie dongfeng ) 
the government has failed to win support from various sides for its decision to halt the construction of the givat hatamar neighborhood of the efrat settlement near bethlehem but to move the building to the nearby givat hazayit hilltop . 
under a resolution adopted by the government last night on the efrat issue , the government will stick to the $date decision to stop settlement construction by the state . 
the construction at the site of the controversial givat hatamar will be suspended , and in its place , the building work will be shifted to givat hazayit , closer to the center of efrat settlement . 
furthermore , an interministerial committee will be set up to implement the decision . 
however , the government found itself seriously split over the issue on the path to reach the resolution as the ministers were divided into three groups . 
four meretz party ministers including education minister amnon rubinstein and environment minister yossi sarid voted against the resolution . 
they demands the government totally freeze building plans near settlements in the occupied territories . 
sarid pointed out that it is the government 's basic policy to refrain from establishing new settlements . 
rubinstein said that he could remain as a cabinet minister because he only had this government to serve . 
on the other side , housing minister binyamin ben-eliezer , economic minister shimon shetreet and industry and trade minister micha harish demanded a continuation of the construction of the givat hatamar neighborhood . 
finally , the resolution , favored by prime minister yitzhak rabin , was able to win the cabinet vote only because the labor party ministers form the overwhelming majority in the coalition . 
the givat hatamar neighborhood plan was strongly protested by palestinians from the nearby el-khader village , who claimed the land belongs to them . 
the palestinians held week-long demonstration at the site as the construction went on . 
meanwhile , the palestinian national authority (pna) has criticized the israeli government of allowing such construction . 
plo chairman yasser arafat and other officials called it a clear violation of the oslo accord , and warned that the peace process would collapse because of settlement expansion . 
reacting to the resolution adopted by the israeli government , saeb erakat , pna minister in charge of municipal affairs , told israel radio that " rabin can not solve the problem by moving his bulldozers from one side of the mountain to the other . " 
" the issue we 're talking about is the halting of all settlement activity , " he said . 
if the israeli government decides to continue establishment of settlements , it is not giving the peace process a chance , he added . 
the israeli government must make a choice between settlements and peace because the two can not be put together , he said . 
rabin last night told the knesset ( israel 's parliament ) that the construction of givat hatamar neighborhood must be halted to preserve the peace process . 
the israel-plo supreme liaison committee headed by foreign minister shimon peres and palestinian chief negotiator nabil shaath is to convene $time in cairo . 
because of last night 's decision , the national religious party (nrp) and the tsomet party submitted a no-confidence motion to the knesset , which the government survived by a vote of $number - $number 
the nrp accused the government of " abandoning jerusalem . " 
in reply , rabin said that the opposition policy to " stretch jerusalem to ramallah and hebron " threatens the unity of the city . 
rabin also said that the government had originally authorized construction at givat hazayit , but due to a " government mishap , " the project had been moved to givat hata $date 
meanwhile , likud chairman binyamin netanyahu criticized the government for giving in to " palestinian violence " and " plo political pressure . " 
" this is not a way to rule our country , " he said . 
for the efrat settlers , they are not satisfied with the government decision because it did not allow an immediate construction of the givat hazayit neighborhood . 
efrat chief rabbi shlomo riskin said that they would demand two things from the government : a quick construction of givat hazayit neighborhood , and a guarantee that givat hatamar remains under israeli control . 
settlement leaders said late last night that they would wait for two days to see how the further negotiations on the matter come out before calling for protest action . 
therefore , despite its decision , from various aspects , the government is far from solving the efrat issue and is expected to face more challenges on the issue .

after the breakdown of the sino-u . s. negotiations on intellectual property rights at the end of last year u.s. trade representative mickey kantor published a list of chinese products which are considered targets for trade sanctions . 
to protect china 's sovereign rights and interests , china 's ministry of foreign trade and economic co-operation had to respond accordingly by announcing a retaliation list . 
as the sino-u . s. negotiations on intellectual property rights concern many legal issues , the wcipr office called the seminar , attended by legal experts . 
china 's actions to protect intellectual property , said professor xu , have helped build up a legal system of intellectual property right protection with chinese characteristics . 
he said china welcomes foreign governments ' well-meaning suggestions that will help china complete its system of intellectual property rights . 
however , he added , " it 's our own affair as to how we should act in legislation and law enforcement . " 
since the u.s. demands are against the basic principles guarding international relations - - let alone the fact that such demands are far beyond the range of intellectual property rights - - they have therefore been rejected by china , he noted . 
the u.s. side claimed that china has problems fulfilling its duties in international conventions . 
however , jin yulin , an associate research fellow at the institute of jurisprudence under the chinese academy of social sciences , responded , " the facts are just the opposite , " adding that china has strictly abided by its duties since it signed a memorandum with the u.s. in $date on intellectual property rights , while the u.s. side has not . 
" as a research worker in computer software property rights , i think the u.s. demands are groundless , " noted ying ming , deputy director of the china computer software registration center . 
he noted that softwares are protected in the same way as manuscripts in china . 
" it is no business of the u.s. how china handles its legislation , and the u.s. side cannot say china must do this or that , " he said . 
ying said he finds it difficult to understand why all computer softwares must be approved by a nongovernmental organization , which is designated by the u.s. side . 
" what qualifications does an organization composed voluntarily of a dozen u.s. software companies have to 'approve ' registrations worldwide ? " he asked .

news analysis : interest rates likely to keep moving up 
finance experts here hail the central bank 's latest loan interest rate rise as a landmark reform move , predicting that more minor rises will follow in the foreseeable future . 
the rate rise was too weak to contribute significantly to the central government 's efforts to slow down economic growth and reduce inflation , they noted . 
contrary to the past practice of raising the rates on individual bank deposits $number , the central bank ( the people 's bank of china ) this time $number raised interest rates on loans to the commercial banks - - which is considered the central bank 's benchmark rate - - and then allowed these banks to move up the rates on their loans to enterprises , pegged to the central bank 's loan rate . 
" this indicates that the central bank has begun to pay attention to bringing its operations into line with international practice . 
we can see it as a prelude to the reform of the country 's interest rate system , " commented tao liming , deputy director of the finance research institute under the bank of china . 
in an announcement on $date last year , the people 's bank of china said it would raise the interest rate on its loans to commercial banks by an average of $number percentage points , starting $date . 
it also ordered the banks to raise rates on loans to fixed-assets investment by $number percentage points . 
analysts here hold that the latest interest rate hike may , to some extent , ease the operating difficulties of chinese banks largely caused by the imbalance between rates on bank loans and deposits . 
after the central bank raised the rates on bank deposits twice last year , the interest rate of one-year deposits throughout $date arrived at a par with the rate on loans $number percent . 
commercial banks , meanwhile , have been paying subsidies on fixed deposits of three years and over to counter the ravages of inflation . 
all this has left banks incredibly thin profit margins , the analysts said , pointing out that individual savings have been growing very rapidly and a stringent ceiling has been slapped on bank lending . 
official sources cited nearly $number yuan paid out in interest rates on bank deposits alone in $number 
the analysts said that the central bank has been caught in a dilemma . 
it is lured to raise interest rates to contain inflation and improve commercial banks ' profits . 
any further rise of china 's current interest rates , already generally higher than the international level , will make the country more attractive to foreign capital and make the renminbi appreciate further , forcing the central bank to put into circulation more cash in order to purchase foreign currencies to help stabilize the market exchange rate of the renminbi . 
however , the experts stressed , there actually exists very limited maneuvering room for the central bank to raise interest rates further , as many large and medium-sized state firms can hardly bear the present rates because of their poor performance . 
but it is also virtually impossible to lower interest rates due to rapid economic growth and high inflation , they maintained . 
besides , a cut in interest rates will affect people 's enthusiasm to save money , draining the fund source of banks . 
judging by the anti-inflation and credit-squeeze theme of a recent national economic work meeting , the analysts said , they believe that interest rates on bank deposits will also climb appropriately later , in a reaction to the latest bank loan rate increase .

tough measures needed to curb inflation : economists 
both reform and administrative measures should be adopted to rein in china 's double-digit inflation in $date , economists here say . 
while the furthering of economic reforms will help bring down inflation in the long run , administrative measures need to be taken at present , according to hu dinghe and mu huaping , two researchers with the central bank , the people 's bank of china . 
in $date , inflation soared to a record high of $number percent , posing a serious threat to the nation 's social and economic development , the economists say in an article carried by the people 's daily . 
in their analytical report , they blame excessive fixed-asset investments and increased consumption , a long-existing phenomenon , for the rampant inflation . 
" although the central government has repeatedly called for harder controls on investment and consumption , they have in fact been out of control , " they said . 
official figures indicate that fixed-asset investments jumped by $number percent last year and the growth of administrative outlays outstripped increases in productivity . 
shortages of some farm products caused by natural disasters , and price readjustments in line with reforms carried out last year have added to the inflationary trend . 
the economists point out that the main factor in causing excessive inflation was the lack of an effective market economic mechanism . 
the nation has been on the path toward a market economy from the previous planned economy since $number 
during the process , the effectiveness of economic planning has been greatly reduced , but a new mechanism to replace it has not yet been established , they say . 
reforms should now be strengthened with forceful means to scale down investment and consumption , the economists say , adding that a focal point is the improvement of the function of government departments in macro-economic regulation . 
the central bank must be given independent status in setting and implementing monetary policy , while the fiscal policy should aim at achieving self-balance through the issuance of state debt , they say . 
furthermore , administrative measures are necessary during the period of transition to a market economy , especially for the rectification of the commercial sector . 
the chaos in the movement of goods in recent years has to a large extent given rise to inflation , they say , meaning that governmental departments should supervise changes in market prices more closely to ensure sound movement . 
meanwhile , the economists suggest that the central government tighten planning over fixed-asset investments and set strict guidelines for local governments . 
they also recommend that tight monetary and fiscal policies be continued in the short term , with the government relying more on interest rate readjustments . 
because china registered a sharp increase in its foreign exchange reserves last year , the state can expand imports of some selected goods to increase their supply on the domestic market , they say .

chinese firms urged to answer anti-dumping allegations promptly 
the chinese government has demanded all chambers of commerce and enterprises involved in exporting and importing to respond promptly to increasing anti-dumping allegations against chinese exports . 
statistics of the chinese ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation (moftec) show that $date saw $number cases of chinese exports being subject to anti-dumping investigations and having anti-dumping taxes imposed . 
fifteen of the cases took place in the united states , followed by nine in europe , and five in mexico . 
an official with moftec said that in order to keep such things from happening , chinese enterprises should change the current practice of making chinese products competitive in international markets mainly by lowering prices and selling large quantities . 
with increased quality , prices will rise , and chinese enterprises will not be mis-understood as being guilty of dumping , he added . 
after a company is sued for dumping , the relevant chamber of commerce should answer the lawsuit promptly to reduce the loss , the official said . 
since moftec 's issuing of regulations in response to anti-dumping allegations at the beginning of last year , all chambers of commerce for exports and imports have played an important role in organizing the response to such lawsuits , the official said , adding that many enterprises involved also responded rapidly to get just results . 
the chinese products involved in the anti-dumping suits include clothing , machinery , electrical products , chemical products , food , and light-industry products . 
the companies whose exports were arranged through bidding were also being sued last year . 
the official pointed out that with competition in the international market becoming more intense , this year will also see the situation of chinese products being " severe " in this . 
since the products had anti-dumping taxes levied against them , china suffered direct losses worth $number million u.s. dollars last year , and uncountable indirect losses , he said . 
" this is because when fines were imposed , they were levied for five years or even longer in some countries , " he said . 
" moreover , such actions in some countries affect neighboring countries importing similar chinese products , who may follow suit . 
as a result , china will lose a large number of markets over the long run . " 
the official blamed some countries for implementing protectionism by using anti-dumping as a pretext . 
he said that those countries are afraid that competitive chinese products will expand the occupation of their domestic market . 
because the cost and price of china 's products in light-industry , machinery , electrical goods , and textiles are very low , they are very competitive in the international market , the official noted . 
under the current system of a socialist market economy , china 's foreign trade companies and their manufacturing enterprises , as independent units , should shoulder the losses themselves and it is not wise for them to export their products with the price below cost because they will suffer a lot , the official noted . 
many chinese laws such as the foreign trade law and the anti-unfair competition law all stipulate that dumping is an unfairly competitive measure , and the chinese government has repeatedly issued orders forbidding such activity , he added . 
however , the official said , many countries , disregarding the facts , have taken unjust measures when filing anti-dumping suits against chinese products . 
when investigating the chinese products to see whether they were exported with under-cut prices , the countries concerned did not do their calculations according to real labour and raw material costs , but took a $number - world country as the standard , he said . 
the official said that although the overall economic development of some $number - world countries is similar to china 's , a great difference still exists between the prices of concrete products . 
so , the principle of taking a $number - world country as standard is unjust , he said . 
some countries began to levy anti-dumping fines without taking proper judicial procedures , or made anti-dumping investigations of many kinds of products at one time , which is also unjust , he added .

for female mammals , rank has a price 
in the animal kingdom , social ranks for female mammals come with a price , at least in the reproductive area , according to a latest study .

dr. richard goldbloom with dalhousie university , halifax , nova scotia called for public policy based on " evidence as the rule instead of consensus . "

a new meta-analysis of $number trials by dr. alexander g. logan of the university of toronto indicated no blood pressure effects in sodium intervention trials of normotensive individuals . 
low-sodium dieters , to their detriment , reduced other vital nutrients including calcium by $number and iron by $number , stated dr. cynthia morris with oregon health sciences university .

mixed prospects forecast for chinese currency 's exchange rate 
the exchange rate of the chinese currency " yuan " will remain stable for the next few months , chinese financial experts said here recently , adding they also anticipate sizable fluctuations in one year 's time . 
in the most recent research report published here $time , deputy director of the finance research institute of the bank of china tao liming said that the yuan will stay solid because inflation remains high and the central bank , the people 's bank of china , is unlikely to ease credit for some time . 
" this will leave local money in short supply , keeping enterprises from purchasing foreign currency , " he said . 
he explained that china 's bank interest rates , though generally higher than international ones , are still not positive due to rampant inflation . 
this gives the central bank some room to manoeuvre in raising rates further . 
higher interest rates for the chinese currency will continue to help attract more foreign capital to china . 
official statistics show that china 's $date foreign exchange reserves were double $date 's figure , at nearly $number u.s. dollars . 
but the country 's foreign trade enjoyed a surplus of only $number u.s. dollars last year .

such a change could occur if the government is to limit foreign debts , which grew by $number percent for two years to some $number u.s. dollars by the end of last year . 
" this would paint a new picture of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market , " he said . 
according to tao , the central bank currently acts as the biggest trader in the bank exchange market . 
it has to buy surplus dollars on the international market to stabilize the exchange rate , indicating that china 's foreign exchange market is not yet well-developed . 
as the commercial banks are allowed to play a bigger role in the market , the foreign exchange rate will fluctuate in a wider range , tao predicted . 
since china has promised to make its currency fully convertible by the year $date , it will face considerable pressure to be devalued , said an official with the shanghai branch of the people 's bank of china .
