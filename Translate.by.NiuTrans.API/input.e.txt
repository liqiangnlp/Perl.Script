San Francisco (CNN) -- The pilot of the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed in San Francisco over the weekend had no experience landing a Boeing 777 at that airport. And one of the two teens who died after the crash may have been run over by a first responder's vehicle.
The revelations are the latest in a flurry of developments from the crash at San Francisco International Airport that killed two 16 year-old girls from China and sent 182 people to the hospital Saturday.
The flight, with 307 people on board, originated in Shanghai, China, and stopped in Seoul, South Korea. It was preparing to land in San Francisco when the rear of the plane struck the edge of the runway, severing the tail and causing the plane to erupt in smoke and flames.
Questions surround tragedy
The San Francisco Fire Department said one of the girls killed may have been struck by an emergency vehicle, San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault said.
"Part of our examination is to determine the cause of death. Our examination will determine whether it was from the airplane crash or secondary incident," Foucrault said.
